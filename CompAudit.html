                engaging is the app? Is it <br>              
                visually appealing? Does <br>             
                it have sound and <br>          
               animation to capture the <br>               
                user's attention? Does it  <br>              
                have a good balance of <br>
                challenge and reward?</td>
            <td class="Above7">Kahoot makes excellent use of gamification elements like gaining points and trying to beat others in a competitive context. It also makes use of lively animation, vibrant colouring, catchy music and satisfying sound effects to keep the user engaged. It turns learning into a fun and competitive quiz game for a whole class of students or a study group. (10/10) </td>
            <td class="Above7">Typing.com uses gamification very well to engage the player. Elements like an Exp bar, typing minigames and challenges help turn learning to type into a game to win. The satisfying visual and audio effects add a lot to the experience. Colour contrast for correct and incorrect answers and large buttons help turn the general lessons into enjoyable experiences. (9/10) </td>
            <td class="Above7">CodeCombat's mechanics are an excellent gamification of learning programming. By using different heroes, levels and unlockable gear, it turns learning a code language into an RPG game, which helps to motivate the user to keep learning. It translates relatively complex concepts like programming movement into a simpler form through gamification.  (8/10) </td>

            <td class="Question">Progress tracking: How <br>
                well does the app track    <br>    
                the user's progress? Does      <br>  
                it provide feedback and        <br>
                recommendations to help       <br>
                users improve their        <br>
                performance? Does it use       <br>
                data to personalize the      <br>
                learning experience?</td>
                <td class="Above7">Kahoot allows the user to select specific topics in Maths, Science, Business, etc and tracks the number of minutes of studying per day. Each topic also displays several quizzes that have questions that correspond to the topic selected. However, it does not provide recommendations, nor does it keep regular track of performance, just time spent. (7/10) </td>
                <td class="Above7">Typing.com pays close attention to the user's progress, displaying progress bars on lessons, keeping track of the user’s “problem keys” and having an experience bar to show the user how far they’ve come from the start. It also displays average words per minute and average accuracy, so the user has a number to beat. (8/10) </td>
                <td class="Above3">CodeCombat tracks progression through levels to complete and gear to obtain. In my experience with the site, there wasn’t a section where the game suggested any common mistakes or recommendations for improvement, although it does use its gamification elements quite well as methods of measuring progress.

                User experience: How <br>
                user-friendly is the app?<br>
                Is it easy to navigate and<br>
                use? Does it have clear<br>
                instructions and<br>
                prompts? Does it have a<br>
                well-designed interface?
            </td>
            <td class="Above3">Kahoot has decent visual design aesthetically, however it fails at clarity since it bombards the user with tens of quizzes. Even in specific topic menus, unrelated quizzes appear, making it hard to understand what does and does not pertain to the topic. It does provide account customisation with usernames, profile pictures and unique in-app characters, making it a more personal experience. (6/10) </td>
            <td class="Above7">Typing.com is a very user-friendly website. The user can customise their page with different visual themes, options are denoted clearly, complete and incomplete lessons contrast each other and there isn’t too much visual clutter. The lessons themselves are clear in their instructions, using a visual to represent how to use the keyboard properly. (9/10) </td>
            <td class="Below3">CodeCombat's visuals are quite cluttered and very much outdated. It is incredibly overwhelming when the user first logs in with so many options and buttons that aren’t very visually appealing. Additionally, the free version of the site barely allows you to use any of its features without paying for the premium service. Other than that, the typing interface when in lessons, the instructions and the actual visuals of the game are certainly clear enough to function for the average user. (3/10) </td>
